	                <p>This uses a "byte" pattern.  Each ordinal position corresponds with the action of Create, Read, Update and Delete.</p>
	                <p>0 == Action NOT Allowed.  1 == Action Allowed.</p>
	                <p>Example:  0110 would be Cannot Create, Allow Read, Allow Update, Cannot Delete.</p>
	                <p>Example:  1111 would be Allow Create, Allow Read, Allow Update, Allow Delete.</p>
	                <p>In the case of removing an EO from a relationship, if the parent EO relationship is mandatory it will show no delete button. You need to provide an additional rule for "isEntityDeletable"</p>
